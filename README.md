 ### Fit for Big data
 - Strong product for processing big data â€“ the hard disk size is the limit
 - Designed to **conserve memory;** report memory data is stored on the disk, in RocksDB.
 - Built in support for Akka streams input
 
### Flexibility
 - Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines (i.e., Jenkins)
 - Reactive Reports applications can run on any JVM runtime
 - Reactive Reports applications can be Dockerized
 - Applications can integrate with other libraries, such as AI/ML, NLP and others.

### Speed
 - Uses scalaz memoizing for speeding calculations
 - Generated a 20,000-page report with images in 4 minutes
 
### Graphics
 - Built in support for French and Spanish character set 
 - Can build graphics using the PDF standard (tables, color gradients, pie charts, bar charts, etc.)
 - Can include external images (ie: JPG, etc)
 - Can create in document or external links, and table of contents at beginning or end of reports
 - Reactive Reports has the full control and responsibility over the PDF generation capability

### Language details
 - In Java, reports are created using Java code.
 - In Scala, Reactive Reports provides a DSL - domain specific language - for report creation. This DSL is simple to use. 
 - Reactive Reports can be used in Scala 2.13, 2.12 , 2.11 and in Java 7 and 8.

  
## Getting started
   
### 1 - Using SBT - Recommended for Scala
Include the following in your `build.sbt` file:

```
libraryDependencies += "com.github.sysalto" %% "reactivereports-core" % "1.0.7"
libraryDependencies += "com.github.sysalto" %% "reactivereports-pdf-render" % "1.0.7"
```

### 2 - Using Maven - Recommeded for Java

Use the latest Maven artifacts for Reactive Reports. Example:

```
